# **Northcoders News APP**

### **Project Overview:**



<br>

#### **Tech:** React and Bootstrap
---

This project utilises a back end API I built in Node.js with Express.js, storing all comments, articles, users and topics in a **postgres** database.

At the forefront of learning with this project, I wanted simple design - both in design and build - opting for Bootstrap for pre-made components, whilst focusing on mobile-first resonsiveness and accessibility.

This site has some features that are hard-coded, such as the login page. This is to allow certain features of the page to be available only if authorised - _it is by no means an authentication system_.

At the forefront of my design it has been imperative to ensure that user experience was present on all features, the site uses CRUD operations from my backend allowing a 'logged on' user to add comments/articles, delete their comments/articles, add new topics and vote on them too.

### **Getting Started**

---

<br>

It's incredibly simple and should be familiar to anyone who has used social media sites such as reddit or any blog-format site. Select a username from the user tab and login from the navbar with the password: password123 [please note, remove the '@' from the username on login].

From there, you can post comments, vote on posts and read any stock articles in place.
