# **Northcoders News APP**

## **Project Overview:**

---

<br>

This project was my first front end project using **React**, since graduating from Northcoders I have since used it as a sandbox for getting familiar with **Bootstrap** and general styling. It utilises a back end API I built, storing all comments, articles, users and topics in a **postgres** database whilst using **Node.js** plus **Express** for http requests.

It was my intention to learn more about accessibility in this process, alongside honing in on workflow to be able to have more utilities at my finger tips when initially creating a skeleton framework for a site design. This site has some features that are hard-coded, such as the login page. This is to allow certain features of the page to be available only if authorised - _it is by no means an authentication system_.

At the forefront of my design it has been imperative to ensure that user experience was present on all features, the site uses CRUD operations from my back end allowing a 'logged on' user to add comments/articles, delete their comments/articles, add new topics and vote on them too.

## **Getting Started**

---

<br>

It's incredibly simple and should be familiar to anyone who has used social media sites such as reddit or any blog-format site. Select a username from the user tab and login from the navbar with the password: password123 [please note, remove the '@' from the username on login].

From there, you can post comments, vote on posts and read any stock articles in place.
